     But God, how deadly dull to sample
     Let others learn from his example!
     and glumly serves the medicine bottle,
     And the sly baseness, fit to throttle,
     and sighs, and asks oneself all through:
     and never played a shrewder trick.

     he really forced one to admire him --

     Friends of my Ruslan and Lyudmila,
     reader, or where you've shone and glittered!
     Onegin, my good friend, was littered
     with this the hero of my tale:
     There once I too strolled back and forth:
     but I'm allergic to the North...1
     where you were born as well, I think,
     and bred upon the Neva's brink,
     let me acquaint you on the nail

     Such were a young rake's meditations --

     He was sweet-natured, and yet wild.
     Monsieur l'Abbé, the mediocre,
     promptly had nothing left to give.
     had only debts on which to live.
     a mild rebuke was his worst mark,
     and then a stroll in Letny Park.
     Fate saved Evgeny from perdition:
     at first Madame gave him tuition,
     After a fine career, his father
     He gave three balls a year, and rather
     No moralizing from this joker;
     reluctant to exhaust the boy,
     treated his lessons as a ploy.

     it was goodbye, Monsieur l'Abbé.
     His hair was fashionably curled,
     his bow was wholly unaffected.

     of hope and gloom, romantic-fashion,
     But when the hour of youthful passion
     Eugene was free, and as a dresser
     made London's dandy his professor.
     The World found this enough to treat
     Eugene as clever, and quite sweet.
     in the mazurka he was light,

     Unforced, as conversation passed,

     stumblingly call to mind he did
     two verses of the Aeneid.
     that stretched from Romulus in his prime
     across the years to our own time.

     add vale when he signed a letter;
     Now Latin's gone quite out of favour;
     Onegin knew enough to savour
     for raking up historic dust
     or stirring annalistic must;

     which Ovid sang, for which the bard,
     condemned to a lifetime of hard,
     Evgeny's total store of knowledge
     where he was master of his college,
     I have no leisure to recall;
     the art he'd studied best of all,
     ended his wild career of fashion
     this was the science of that passion
     what occupied his chafing powers
     throughout the boredom of the hours --
     its work, its torture, its enjoyment,
     his young heyday's supreme employment,

     How early he'd learnt to dissemble,
     In languid silence, or the flame
     of eloquence, and just the same
     how bold or bashful there, and here
     in casual letters of confession --
     How soft his glance, or at discretion
     or pine, persuade of yes or no,
     how brilliant with its instant tear!
     and act the humble or imperious,
     the indifferent, or the deadly serious!
     one thing inspired his breath, his heart,
     and self-oblivion was his art!
     to hide a hope, to make a show

     pursue his love -- and at one bound
     and listen for the heart's first sound,
     for unmeant kindness -- how he shone!
     impart such lessons as you please!
     then afterwards, alone, at ease,
     swaying the artless, waiting on
     secure a secret assignation,
     then he'd implore a declaration,
     frightening with all despair's disguises,
     How well he donned new shapes and sizes --
     with passion and with shrewd obliqueness
     stalking the momentary weakness,
     amusing, flattering with the best,
     startling the ingenuous with a jest,

     But you, blest husbands, to the end
     you kept your friendship with our friend:
     he'd pop the poison in his chalice!
     what traps he'd set him, with what malice
     always contented with his life,
     and with his dinner, and his wife.
     Faublas'3 disciple for an age --
     as was the old suspicious sage,
     When out to burst a rival's bubble,
     How early on he learnt to trouble
     the subtle spouse was just as loyal --
     and the majestic, antlered royal,
     the heart of the professional flirt!
     how well he knew the way to hurt --

     Eugene attends the boulevard,
     to do them all is easy game.
     Which one comes first? It's just the same
     until Bréguet's unsleeping chime
     advises him of dinner-time.
     have each asked him to a soirée:
     and there at large he goes patrolling
     Meanwhile, attired for morning strolling
     complete with broad-brimmed bolivar,
     What? Invitations? Yes, three houses
     Some days he's still in bed, and drowses,
     when little notes come on a tray.
     where shall he go, my rogue, my hearty?
     a ball here, there a children's party;

        XVI

     youth's choice, the flower of French cuisine:
     sits with Limburg's vivacious cheese
     He mounts the sledge, with daylight fading:
     his collar in its beaver braiding
     He's flown to Talon's,4 calculating
     that there his friend Kavérin's5 waiting;
     and truffles, which have ever been
     wine of the Comet6 fills the cup;
     he arrives -- the cork goes flying up,
     and ananas, the gold of trees.
     glitters with hoar-frost all about.
     ``Make way, make way,'' goes up the shout;
     before him roast beef, red and gory,
     and pâté, Strasbourg's deathless glory,

     that world where every man's a critic
     boo Phaedra out as paralytic,
     encore Moëna,7 -- and rejoice
     to know the audience hears his voice.
     who'll clap an entrechat, or scoff
     at Cleopatra, hiss her off,
     More wine, he calls, to drench the flaming
     when Bréguet's chime is heard proclaiming
     He's off -- this ruthless legislator
     for the footlights, this fickle traitor
     to all the most adored actrices,
     this denizen of the coulisses
     the new ballet he should be at.

     that king of the satiric scene,
     with young Semyónova,9 and there
     tribute of tears, applause's shrilling,

     with comedies of swarm and din;
     there caustic Shakhovskóy8 came in
     and the derivative Knyazhnín:8

     Enchanted land! There like a lampion
     our friend Katénin8 brought to bear
     that's where my years of youth were spent.

     once more Corneille's majestic story;

     My goddesses! Where are you banished?
     have other maidens, since you vanished,
     as I recall a bygone age?

     taken your place, though not your throne?
     lend ears to my lugubrious tone:
     my disillusioned glass, and yearn,
     that alien scene must I now turn
     Russia's Terpsichore, shall never

     shall my sad gaze no more alight

     Istómina,11 thronged all around
     by Naiads, one foot on the ground,
     then suddenly she's off, and there
     The house is packed out; scintillating,
     the gallery claps -- it's bored with waiting --
     bound where the magic bow will send her,
     she's up and flying through the air
     Then with a half-ethereal splendour,
     twirls the other slowly as she pleases,
     like fluff before Aeolian breezes;
     the boxes; boiling, pit and stalls;
     and up the rustling curtain crawls.
     she'll spin this way and that, and beat
     against each other swift, small feet.

     he turns away: ``I've had enough --
     he's seen it all; with looks and fashion
     they all have richly earned a pension;''
     he's viewed the boxes without passion,
     he's bowed politely; his attention
     straight to his stall, then turns his glasses
     Applause. Onegin enters -- passes
     across the public's toes; he steers
     on unknown ladies in the tiers;
     across the stage; he yawns: ``Ballet --
     wanders in a distracted way

        XXII

     Still tumbling, devil, snake and Cupid
     Still in the porch, exhausted-stupid,
     on stage are thumping without cease;
     the horses fidget worse and worse;
     the coachmen ring the fire, and curse
     still coughing, hissing, clapping, champing;
     the audience still is busy stamping,
     still shivering in the bitter weather
     their lords, and thwack their palms together;
     the footmen sleep on the pelisses;
     by now he's driving home to dress.
     but Eugene's out from din and press:
     outside and in they star the night;
     still everywhere the lamps are bright;

        XXIII

     all this, at eighteen years of age,
     adorned the sanctum of our sage.
     Shall I depict with expert knowledge
     where the prize-boy of fashion's college
     across the Baltic in exchange
     for wood and tallow; all the range
     Parisian taste invents for one --
     is dressed, undressed, and dressed once more?
     Whatever for caprice of spending
     ingenious London has been sending
     for friends of languor, or of fun,

     a masculine disguise to aid
     custom is despot of mankind.

     shadows that flit behind the glazing
     we'd better hasten to the ball,

     along the street where slumber drowses,
     of ladies and of freakish fops.
     project in silhouette the tops
     with lampions studded all about

     where, in a cab, and furious hurry,

        XXVIII

     and everything is cramped and loud;
     while a mazurka holds the crowd;
     spurs of Chevalier Gardes are clinking,
     incendiary looks are slinking,
     and band already tired of blowing,
     and entered. Ballroom overflowing...
     dear ladies' feet fly past like hail,
     and on their captivating trail
     flown like an arrow, then he's given
     Up to the porch our hero's driven:

     to drown the hiss of modish wives.

     the ballroom drove me off my head:
     and where most surely notes are sped.
     yes, focus on them your lorgnette,
     and take due warning from my speech.
     now pay attention, I beseech,
     since I stopped sinning years ago.
     the safest place for declarations,
     In days of carefree aspirations,
     and watch your daughters closer yet,
     or else... or else, may God forfend it!
     You too, mamas, I pray attend it,
     You husbands, deeply I respect you!
     I'm at your service to protect you;
     I only write like this, you know,

        XXX

     three pairs of handsome ones -- yet there
     that all of Russia can't contribute
     one pair! I pay them memory's tribute
     the heartache that they bring lies deep.
     though cold I am and sad; in sleep
     exists for me one special pair!
     I love their feet -- though I confess
     the crush, the glitter and the gladness,
     the atmosphere of youth and madness,
     the ladies' calculated dress;
     I'd still like dances to this day:
     I've wasted too much life away!
     But, did they not corrupt society,
     Alas, on pleasure's wild variety
     {48}

        XXXI

     The happiness of youth is dead,
     just like, on turf, your fleeting tread.
     Oh, when, and to what desert banished,
     my little feet, where have you vanished,
     you left no steps that could be tracked:
     Was it for you that I became
     long since unstirred by praise and fame
     across our snows of northern bleakness
     Nursed in the orient's languid weakness,
     you loved the opulent contact
     of rugs, and carpets' rich refinement.
     and fatherland and grim confinement?
     what flowers of spring display your dint?
     madman, can you forget their print?

        XXXII

     Diana's breast, the cheeks of Flora,
     on springtime grasses of the field,
     under the table's linen shield,
     of recompense beyond endurance,
     It fascinates by its assurance
     in winter, on the cast-iron fender,
     My love for it is just as tender,
     it frankly, I'm a firm adorer

     of the Terpsichorean foot.
     the wilful fancies of the heart.
     and fastens, like a term of art,

     No, never in the hottest fire
     of boiling youth did I desire
     with any torture so exquisite
     each in tumultuous turn descending
     On the seashore, with storm impending,
     I longed, like every breaker hissing,
     to smother her dear feet with kissing.
     the flaming roses of a cheek,
     to kiss Armida's lips, or seek
     of raging passion's surge and roll
     ever so roughly rocked my soul!
     to lie down at her feet like slaves!
     how envious was I of the waves
     or languid bosoms; and no visit

        XXXIV

     I feel a small foot in my hand;
     sometimes, in reverie's sacred land,
     they don't deserve what they inspire
     enough of my loquacious lyre:
     fancies once more are hotly bubbling,
     once more that touch is fiercely troubling
     But, now I've praised the queens of fashion,
     in terms of poetry or passion --
     I grasp a stirrup with affection,
     Another page of recollection:
     are just as nimble as their feet.
     their looks and language in deceit
     the blood within my withered heart,
     once more the love, once more the smart...
     {50}

        XXXV

     from ball to bed behold him come;
     the merchant's up, the cabman's walking
     towards his stall, the pedlar's hawking;
     while Petersburg's already rousing,
     And Eugene? half-awake, half-drowsing,
     untirable, at sound of drum:
     see with their jugs the milk-girls go
     punctilious in his cotton cap,
     has opened up his serving-trap.
     The city's early sounds awake her;
     and more than once the German baker,
     blue smoke of chimneys goes aloft,
     shutters are opened and the soft
     and crisply crunch the morning snow.

        XXXVI

     at feasts, was strong and fancy-free?
     Was it to no effect that he,
     his life till dawn's already making,
     Then, after midday he'll be waking;
     with brilliant conquests by the shower,
     his freedom, in his youth's first flower,
     Exhausted by the ballroom's clamour,
     he sleeps, away from glare and glamour,
     this child of luxury and delight.
     converting morning to midnight,
     and every day its own enjoyment?
     But was it happy, his employment,
     tomorrow just like yesterday.
     always monotonously gay,
     {51}

        XXXVII

     and he was bored with social noise;
     No, early on his heart was cooling
     no, not for long were belles the ruling
     soon, infidelity proved cloying,
     and friends and friendship, soul-destroying;
     his Strasbourg pie, or point a moral,
     and though he liked a fiery quarrel --
     not every day could he wash down
     his beefsteak with champagne, or drown
     objective of his thoughts and joys:
     with cranium aching fit to split;
     full of his usual pith and wit,
     with sabre's slash, and bullet's blast.
     yet he fell out of love at last

     to life grew colder than the dead.
     to blow his brains out, but in stead
     he stalked the drawing-rooms, remote
     from Boston's cloth or gossip's quote;
     So, like Childe Harold, glum, unpleasing,
     no glance so sweet, no sigh so teasing,
     The illness with which he'd been smitten
     something like spleen, that scourge of Britain,
     it mastered him in slow gradation;
     thank God, he had no inclination
     no, nothing caused his heart to stir,
     and nothing pierced his senses' blur.
     should have been analysed when caught,
     or Russia's chondria, for short;

     the highest circles are a bore.
     you were the first ones he forswore;
     so pure, so spotless through and through,
     but by and large their talk's a hash
     of the most harmless, hopeless trash.
     some ladies preach from Say and Bentham,
     It's true, I'll not misrepresent them,
     at once they give a man the spleen.
     so virtuous that, no sooner seen,
     so pious, and so clever too,
     And what's more, they're so supercilious,
     so circumspect, and so punctilious,
     for in our time, beyond dubiety,
     Capricious belles of grand Society!

     of work made him feel sick, and still
     no word came flowing from his quill;
     locked himself up inside his den
     and with a yawn took up his pen,
     he failed to join that sharp profession
     and tried to write, but a hard session
     You too, prime beauties in your flower
     by drozhkies jaunting at full power

     the ancients have gone stiff and cold,
     the moderns rage against the old.
     here's boredom, madness or pretence,
     here there's no conscience, here no sense;
     in taffeta of mourning black.
     and hid the bookshelf's dusty stack
     of other's thought -- a splendid goal;
     oppressed by emptiness of soul,
     Idle again by dedication,
     he strove to achieve the appropriation
     he read, and read -- no satisfaction:
     with shelves of books deployed for action,
     they're all chained up in different fetters,
     He'd given up girls -- now gave up letters,

        XLV

     our lives were flat, and what had fired
     both hearts to blaze had now expired;
     his strangeness, wholly unaffected,
     which held him silently subjected,
     The bitterness was mine -- the ice
     was his; we'd both drunk passion's chalice:
     there waited for us both the malice
     his mind, so cold and so precise.
     I liked his quality, the dream
     retired, as he, from fashion's stream,
     in lives that were just dawning then.
     of blind Fortuna and of men
     Escaped from social rhyme and reason,
     I was Onegin's friend that season.

        XLVI

     At first Onegin's tongue produced
     a haze in me, but I grew used
     his epigrams topped up with bile.
     his virulence that made you smile,
     a great attraction to conversing.
     to his disputing and his cursing;
     He who has lived and thought is certain
     days that are lost behind the curtain,
     for him all sham has found rejection,
     he's gnawed by serpent Recollection,
     on most occasions between friends,
     and by Repentance. All this lends,
     to scorn the men with whom he deals;
     ghostlike, must trouble him who feels --

     the silence when our talk had ceased!
     Like convicts in a dream released
     now sensitive, and now carefree,
     recalling earlier loves, did we,
     we were swept off, in reverie's haze,
     and when its waters were not showing,
     How often, when the sky was glowing,
     drink in the midnight benediction,
     from gaol to greenwood, by such fiction
     recalling earlier time's romances,
     of Dian's visage, in our fancies
     to the beginning of our days.

     and then a drozhky's clopping sound
     swam on the river's dreaming face,
     and then, with an enchanting grace,
     Yet sweeter far, at such a time,
     the strain of Tasso's octave-rhyme!
     and leant upon the granite shelf;
     just as the Poet15 paints himself.
     came distant horns, and gallant singing.
     and then a boat, with oars a-swinging,
     just sentries to each other calling,
     Silence was everywhere enthralling;
     he stood there, pensive and forgetful,
     Evgeny stood, with soul regretful,

     the tongue of love and of Petrarch.
     from her my lips will learn and mark
     O Brenta, I'll see you in dream;
     the magic voices of your stream,
     through it they're known to me, and kin.
     Italian nights, when I'll drink in
     your molten gold, your charmed infusion;
     I'll float in gondola's seclusion;
     O Adrian waves, my invocation;
     hear, once more filled with inspiration,
     with a Venetian maiden who
     sacred to children of Apollo!
     can chatter, and be silent too,
     Proud Albion's lyre is what I follow,

     when shall I start on my escape?
     It's time to drop astern the shape
     my Africa,18 where waves break high,
     ``it's time!'' and freedom hears my hail.
     I signal to each passing sail.
     land where my heart is buried deep.
     land where I learned to love and weep,
     I walk the shore,17 I watch the weather,
     When comes my moment to untether?
     of the dull shores of my disfavour,
     to mourn for Russia's gloomy savour,
     Beneath storm's vestment, on the seaway,
     battling along that watery freeway,
     and there, beneath your noonday sky,

        LI

     before Onegin there collected
     His father died; and (as expected)
     but soon the ways we trod were parted
     Eugene would willingly have started
     for quite a while by fortune's hand.
     with me to see an alien strand;
     To private tastes we each subscribe:
     the usurers' voracious tribe.
     old Uncle's end was soon to be.
     or else, from far off, he could see
     Evgeny, hating litigation,
     finding in that no deprivation --
     and satisfied with what he'd got,
     made over to them his whole lot,
     {57}

        LII

     a corpse on boards was all he found,
     an offering ready for the ground.
     and set off prompter than a whistle
     Evgeny read the sad epistle
     Uncle, in bed, and near to dying,
     In fact one day a note came flying
     from the agent, with this tale to tell:
     wished him to come and say farewell.
     as fast as post-horses could go,
     exercised, under lucre's banner,
     but, when he'd rushed to Uncle's manor,
     (my tale's beginning here repeats);
     in sighs and boredom and deceits
     already yawned before the show,

     for his old courses to be changed.
     and glad he was he'd thus arranged
     they buried Uncle, congregated
     to eat and drink, then separated
     Eugene turned countryman. He tasted
     till then had been dispersed and wasted --
     with grave goodbyes to the bereaved,
     as if some goal had been achieved.
     there gathered at the coffin-side
     of every funeral far and wide;
     mills, lands and waters -- he whose goods

     The yard was bursting with dependants;

     the murmur where the streamlet played...
     the coolness of the sombre glade,
     and dutifully shared his life
     just like a shadow, or a wife.
     he saw that, as in cities, here
     gripped him no more; soon they were raising
     the third day, wood and hill and grazing
     an urge to sleep; soon, clear as clear,
     no mansions, no ballrooms, no bards.
     although there are no streets, no cards,
     the expanse of fields, so wide, so lonely,
     It all seemed new -- for two days only --
     boredom has just as sure an entry,
     Yes, spleen was waiting like a sentry,

        LV

     on waves of far niente floated,
     To harmless idleness devoted,
     I roam by the secluded lake.
     And every morning I awake
     poetic dreams, a brighter fire.
     and country stillness: there the lyre
     No, I was born for peace abounding
     has voices that are more resounding,
     sleep much, read little, and put down
     the thought of volatile renown.
     that once I spent my happiest days?
     such shadowy and leisured ways,
     to freedom, softness and enjoyment:
     Was it not in such sweet employment

     spying my features, as he could,

     the charge that poets are unable
     put back the libel on the table

     I regularly take much pleasure
     O flowers, and love, and rustic leisure,
     the poet's only theme is ``I.''

     of mocking turn, or else a breeder

     then from the Muse there came revival:
     my soul in secret gave survival;
     adore the love that comes in dream.
     To whom do you, from all the train
     of jealous girls, devote its strain?
     In time past, objects of affection
     Poets, I'll say in this connection,
     a frequent question: ``tell me who

     poetry's sacred frenzy, made

     of love's anxiety. Blessed is he
     and, with it, forced renown to come --

     beside unfinished lines, a suite
     my thoughtless pen has stopped designing,
     I write, my heart has ceased its pining,
     will in my soul be hushed and dying.
     dead ash sets no more sparks a-flying;
     Love passed, the Muse appeared, the weather
     now free, I once more weave together
     an ode in twenty-five cantos.
     and soon, oh soon the storm's arrears
     I'm grieving still, but no more tears,
     of ladies' heads, and ladies' feet;

     So now be off to Neva's brink,
     fruits of my labour and my ink...
     I've drawn a plan and a projection,
     Meanwhile my novel's opening section
     there's far too much of contradiction,
     meticulously; in my fiction
     the hero's name's decided too.

     it had no sparkle of sensation,

     he fled from their resounding chatter!
     Their talk, so sound on every matter,

     between their girls and this half-Russian.

     is yawned away with friends and wife
     untouched by envy's bitter smarting,
     he who has cooled down love with parting,

     So a disabled soldier-man,
     we sometimes like to hear again
     reduced to sense, not without pain --

     Eugene, with solemn face, paid heed,
     Lensky ingenuously related
     his tale of youthful love, narrated
     and felt himself love's invalide.

     hate, love, joy, sorrow -- every feeling,
     with deep emotion through and through,
     As, lovingly, in his confession,
     the poet's heart found full expression,
     his conscience's record, and so

     as gay as morning and as clear,

     Mushrooms in brine, for winter eating,

     with sheer enchantment fills her cup!

     But ours, whatever he might be,
     ours was no Grandison -- not he.

     Tatyana, lonely heroine,

     the full fruit of her heart's desire;

     I'll catalogue each simple saying

     in front of you, on every hand,
     you see your fated tempter stand.
     reverie hounds you, and you find
     that poison brew; and in your mind
     for you have, at this early date,
     resigned disposal of your fate.
     you drink the magic draught of yearning,
     shelter for trysts at every turning;
     into a modish tyrant's keeping
     Tatyana dear, with you I'm weeping:
     but first, the dreams that hope can cherish
     Dear Tanya, you're condemned to perish;
     you learn life's sweetness, and with this
     evoke for you a sombre bliss;

     has made the park her brooding-place,
     too faint to stir a further pace:
     sets a sonorous cadence rolling --
     then night comes on; the moon's patrolling
     scarlet with passion's instant flaring,
     her bosom heaves, her cheeks are staring
     suddenly lowering eyes that languish,
     Tatyana, hunted by love's anguish,
     Tatyana, sleepless in the dark,
     makes to her nurse low-voiced remark:
     a nightingale, in forest gloom,
     far-distant heaven's vaulted room;
     upon her lips the breathing dies,
     noise in her ears, glare in her eyes...

        XVII

     but now my brain is darkened, Tanya:
     My mind is fuddled.'' ``Tell me, nyanya,
     years back, to call up many a fable;
     ``What of them, Tanya? I was able,
     of tales of girls, and ghosts, and lore:
     I kept in mind an ancient store
     your early life, unlock your tongue:
     A sorry state of things, it's true!
     ``Why, Tanya, what...?'' ``All's dull and trifling.
     ``I can't sleep, nyanya: it's so stifling!
     were you in love when you were young?''
     The olden days, I want to hear...''
     open the window, sit down near.''
     now I've forgotten all I knew.

     ``I reckon, by God's will. My Vanya

     to see my kin, and in the end
     my father blessed me. So I'd spend
     I was just thirteen years of age.
     was younger still, but at that stage
     had chased me to the world above.''
     ages we'd never heard of love:
     Two weeks the matchmaker was plying
     my hours in fear and bitter crying.
     ``What nonsense, Tanya! in those other
     why, at the thought, my husband's mother
     and sang me to the altar-mat.
     Then, crying, they untwined my plait,

     I'm sick, my dear, I'm sick indeed.
     but you're not paying any heed.''
     and, hands a-tremble, Nyanya prayed
     and put a cross-sign on the maid.
     you're all in fever... heavens above.''
     ``Nurse, I'm not ill; I... I'm in love.''
     ``You're ill, God have you in his keeping,
     I'm near to sobbing, near to weeping!...''
     whatever you may need, just call...
     the Lord have mercy on us all!
     ``Oh nurse, I'm sad, I'm sad, I'm shaken,
     ``So to strange kinsfolk I was taken...

     the grey-haired nurse with kerchiefed head;
     on a small bench by Tanya's bed,
     ``I am in love; leave me alone.''
     whisper repeated to the crone.
     her drops of tears, and seated there,
     ``My dearest heart, you're sick and ailing.''
     ``I am in love,'' Tatyana's wailing
     in quilted coat, where rays were gleaming
     and everything around was dreaming,
     And all the while the moon was shining
     and with its feeble glow outlining
     the girl's pale charms, her loosened hair,
     bathed in the moon's inspiring light.
     in the deep stillness of the night,

        XXI

     Tatyana watched the moon, and floated
     A thought was born, and quickly noted...
     She folds the page, lays down the plume.,
     and in her unconsidered note
     still filled with Eugene, Tanya wrote,
     all a pure maiden's love was breathing.
     Elbow on table, spirit seething,
     Tatyana! it's addressed... to whom?
     She was alone, lit by the moon.
     good night; I swear I'll lie down soon.''
     Give me a pen and give me paper,
     bring up a table, and a taper;
     through distant regions of the heart...
     ``Go, nurse, and leave me here apart.

        XXII

     cold, pure as ice, and as unkind,
     unfathomable to the mind;
     ``Abandon hope for evermore.''9
     the utter virtue of their being,
     shocked by their modish pride, and fleeing
     Ladies of such a cast, I think,
     you too have seen on Neva's brink.
     hell's terrifying imprecation:
     our terror is their consolation.
     Our love is what they most abhor;
     having decyphered on their brow
     I've run a mile, I must avow,
     I've known too many a haughty beauty,
     inexorably wed to duty,

        XXIII

     quite self-absorbed and unaffected
     Thronged by adorers, I've detected
     at least her tone is sometimes found
     more tender than it used to sound.
     by sighs of passion or by praise.
     revive it with another shove --
     frightened to death a timid love,
     the youthful lover once again
     runs after what is sweet, and vain.
     To my astonishment I've seen her,
     having by her severe demeanour
     at least by a regretful kindness;
     I've seen how, trustful in his blindness,
     another, freakish one, who stays
     {95}

        XXIV

     that she's so trustful, and imbued
     by heaven with such an unsubdued
     is this then what you can't forgive?
     Such feckless passion -- as I live,
     that, artless, and without concealing,
     her love obeys the laws of feeling,
     believes in her elected dreaming
     Why is Tatyana guiltier-seeming?
     and heart so tender, it can still
     such stubborn brain, and vivid will,
     imagination, with such reason,
     burst to a fiery blaze in season?
     is it that she, poor simple sweet,
     and has no knowledge of deceit?

        XXV

     doubts, to exhaust the heart, then fire
     jealousy's flame, to light desire;
     we'll keep love's price appreciating,
     ``By virtue of procrastinating
     else, having found his pleasure cloying,
     hope sting it, then we'll try deploying
     at any hour escape his cell.''
     the cunning prisoner can quite well
     she yields to it without condition
     The flirt has reason's cool volition;
     first, we'll take vanity, and let
     we'll draw it deeper in our net;
     Tatyana's love is no by-play,
     like a sweet child. She'll never say:
     {96}

        XXVI

     the letter from Tatyana's hand:
     to save the honour of our land
     has hardly mastered postal prose.
     unhesitating from her tongue,
     what can one do? as said above,
     until this day, a lady's love
     I see another problem looming:
     I must translate -- there's no presuming --
     our native speech had never sprung
     she wrote in French... what a confession!
     in Russian never found expression,
     she never read a Russian paper,
     her Russian was as thin as vapour,
     till now our language -- proud, God knows --

        XXVII

     to whom your hearts are dedicated,
     by all is sweetly mutilated,
     with The Well-Meaner10 on her knee?
     I hear you say. But can you see
     so sketchily possessed by each,
     is it not true that Russian speech,
     They should be forced to read in Russian,
     a lady -- what a grim discussion! --
     for whom, to expiate your crimes,
     you've made so many secret rhymes,
     like native idiom from their lips?
     and it's the foreign phrase that trips
     I ask you, each and every poet!
     the darling objects -- don't you know it? --
     {97}

        XXVIII

     Now, to my cost it may be true
     more closely at the grammar-book;
     heeding the press, will make us look
     on dance-floor, at breakup of ball,
     or seminarist in yellow shawl!
     as bonneted Academician
     Protect me from such apparition
     of grammar, Russian language too.
     however scarlet; free from error
     To me, unsmiling lips bring terror,
     that generations of new beauties,
     that verse will turn to useful duties;
     on me, all this has no effect:
     tradition still keeps my respect.

        XXIX

     words mispronounced, thoughts ill-expressed
     is out of fashion in our time.
     I own it: tender Parny's12 rhyme
     No, incorrect and careless chatter,
     evoke emotion's pitter-patter,
     a blank default would suit me better.
     But that's enough. My beauty's letter
     of Bogdanóvich's11 refrains.
     as youthful sinning, or the strains
     I still find Gallicism delicious
     too weak to change, I'm staying vicious,
     now as before, inside my breast;
     must now employ my pen; somehow
     I gave my word, alas, though now
     {98}

        XXX

     to ask of you that you transcend
     if you'd still been with me, dear friend,
     with heart that's grown unused to praise,
     in music's own bewitching fashion
     the foreign words a maiden's passion
     Bard13 of The Feasts, and heart's depression,
     I would have had the indiscretion
     with an obeisance I'll hand over...
     on Finland's coast a lonely rover --
     he doesn't hear when I address
     his soul with murmurs of distress.
     But he, by sad and rocky ways,
     found for its utterance that night.
     Where are you? come -- and my own right

        XXXI

     or Freischütz as it might be played
     by nervous hands of a schoolmaid:
     here a weak version, incomplete,
     Who taught her all this mad, slapdash,
     heartfelt, imploring, touching trash
     can read enough to get my fill.
     as sacred, lies before me still.
     such careless language of surrender?
     Who taught her an address so tender,
     pale transcript of a vivid master,
     fraught with enticement and disaster?
     Tatyana's letter, treasured ever
     I read with secret pain, and never
     It baffles me. But I'll repeat
     {99}

        Tatyana's Letter to Onegin

     with scorn to make my world a hell.
     is needed, nothing's left to tell.
     ``I write to you -- no more confession
     I know it's now in your discretion

     to speak; believe me: of my shame
     you'd not so much as know the name,
     you'll never leave me to my fate.
     of pity for my wretched state,
     about one thing, till our next meeting.
     on visits to us, and in greeting
     I might have seen you, heard you speak
     to hope that even once a week
     I might have said a word, and then
     you find the country godforsaken;
     our joy in you is warmly taken.
     thought, day and night, and thought again
     ``But, if you've kept some faint impression
     if I'd possessed the slightest reason
     At first I thought it out of season
     But you're not sociable, they say:
     though we... don't shine in any way,

     of inexperience would have passed,
     I'd not have known you, therefore I
     would have been spared this laceration.
     Lost in our backwoods habitation
     In time, who knows, the agitation
     and in the role of virtuous mother
     I would have found a friend, another,
     and faithful wife I'd have been cast.
     ``Why did you visit us, but why?
     {100}

     and pledged to you, and firmly planned:
     no dream. You'd scarce arrived, I reckoned
     and my whole life has been directed
     I know, Godsent one, I'm protected
     until the grave by your strong hand:
     to know you, swooned, and in a second
     long, long ago... no, that could be
     all in a blaze, I said: it's he!
     stirred at your gaze, so strange, so gleaming,
     you'd made appearance in my dreaming;
     unseen, already you were dear,
     my soul had heard your voice ring clear,
     ``Another!... No, another never
     Decreed in highest court for ever...
     in all the world could take my heart!
     heaven's will -- for you I'm set apart;

     helping the poor, or while I mended
     with balm of prayer my torn and rended
     ``You know, it's true, how I attended,
     and, on my bed-head gently leaning,
     with love and comfort in your meaning,
     who in the dark came flashing through
     spirit that anguish had made ill.
     drank in your words when all was still --
     Oh, this could all be false and vain,
     the guardian angel of tradition,
     At this midnight of my condition,
     or some vile agent of perdition
     was it not you, dear apparition,
     sent to seduce? Resolve my doubt.
     a sham that trustful souls work out;
     spoke words of hope? But who are you:
     {101}
     fate could be something else again..,

     to life and hope with just a glance --
     or else disturb my mournful trance
     I've no one here who comprehends me,
     and now a swooning mind attends me,
     dumb I must perish, and alone.
     I trust my fate to your direction,
     I weep, and pray for your protection..,
     Imagine it: quite on my own
     ``So let it be! for you to keep
     henceforth in front of you I weep,
     with censure -- I've done all to earn it!
     My heart awaits you: you can turn it

     and yet your honour is my gage
     ``I close. I dread to read this page...
     and in it boldly I'm confiding''...
     for shame and fear my wits are sliding...

     Now Tanya's groaning, now she's sighing;
     the herdsman's horn proclaimed the morning
     comes clearer through the mists of dawning.
     from off her charming shoulder's drooping,
     and sideways her poor head is stooping.
     the rosy sealing-wafer's drying
     has taken on a silvery gleam;
     Down there, by slow degrees, the stream
     But now the radiance of the moon
     is dimmed. Down there the valley soon
     and roused the village long ago:
     upon her feverish tongue; the slip
     the letter trembles in her grip;
     to Tanya, all's an empty show.

        XXXIII

     fresh as a poppy-flower, your face.''
     your night of fretting's left no trace!
     over the note holds in suspension
     She's paid the sunrise no attention,
     with a small tray and a teacup.
     ``Get up, my child, it's time, get up!
     grey Filatevna, to present her
     Softly the door is opened, enter
     My early bird! you know, last night
     you gave me such a shocking fright!
     she sits with head sunk on her breast,
     her seal with its engraven crest.
     Why, pretty one, you're up already!
     but now, thank God, you're well and steady,

     that not a syllable be uttered
     in these last years all mixed and fluttered.
     ``Which neighbour, dear? My head became
     and not a mention of my name...''
     ``Command me, darling, as you choose.''
     but, nurse, you see... Oh, don't refuse...''
     ``Now don't suppose... let no suspicion...
     ``Oh nurse, a favour, a petition...''

     I'm old, my mind is blunted, Tanya;
     ``How slow you are at guessing, nyanya!''
     times were when I was sharp and bold:
     ``My sweet, my dearest heart, I'm old,
     you know I'm hard to comprehend...
     But don't be cross, my darling friend,
     Now here's a letter, as you see,
     what have your wits to do with me?
     times were, when master's least suggestion...''
     ``Oh nyanya, nyanya, I don't question...
     ``It's nothing, nurse, nothing, I say...
     just send your grandson on his way.''

     Why have you gone all pale and queasy?''

     Tatyana lowered her regard
     as at a censure that was hard.
     ``Today he promised he'd be here,''
     Tatyana flushed, and started shaking.
     ``the mail explains the time he's taking.''
     ``Tell me, what's your companion doing?''
     Olga's adorer comes a-wooing.
     She's dressed since dawn, dead pale; debating,
     Hours pass; no answer; waiting, waiting.
     enquired the lady of the hall:
     ``it seems that he forgot us all.''
     so Lensky answered the old dear:
     No word: another day goes by.
     demanding: when will he reply?

     ``OE'' devotedly inlaced.
     with charming forefinger she traced
     the samovar of evening boiled,
     beneath it, vapour wreathed and coiled.
     Tatyana breathed on the cold pane,
     Already Olga's hand was gripping
     the urn of perfumed tea, and tipping
     and warmed the Chinese teapot; flowing
     Day faded; on the table, glowing,
     meanwhile a hallboy handed cream;
     into the cups its darkling stream --
     plunged in reflection's deepest train,
     and in the misted condensation
     before the window taking station,

     Meanwhile with pain her soul was girdled,
     A sudden clatter!... blood was curdled...
     and tears were drowning her regard.
     Now nearer... hooves... and in the yard
     the allée to the lake, the copse;
     daren't look behind her; fairly dashing --
     breaking the lilac bushes, smashing
     Evgeny! ``Ah!'' Tatyana, fleeting
     light as a shadow, shuns a meeting,
     parterres, she runs to rivulet's brink,
     to gasp, and on a bench to sink.
     through the back porch runs out and flies
     down to the garden, and her eyes
     beds, bridges, lawn, she never stops,

     more and more brightly still they blaze.
     listless, impatient, for the pounding
     They sing; unmoved by their sweet-sounding
     and for her cheeks to cease their blushing;
     but wildly still her heart is rushing,
     a marksman crouching in the green.
     the hare who from afar has seen

     So the poor butterfly will quiver

          La morale est dans la nature des choses.

        (I, II, III, IV, V, VI,1) VII

     now Lovelace's renown has faded
     and heartless pleasure was up-graded;
     There was a period when cold-blooded
     debauchery was praised, and studied
     and stately periwigs, their fame.
     as scarlet heels have lost their name
     as love's technique, when it would blare
     its own perfection everywhere,
     the tighter we can stretch above them
     With womankind, the less we love them,
     the easier they become to charm,
     enticing nets to do them harm.
     those monkeys of the good old days:
     yes, these were our forefathers' ways,
     {109}

        VIII

     diversely urging the same plea,
     on points that all long since agree --
     gossip, and tricks, and the patrolling
     Who's not disgusted by cajoling,
     of husband's friendship -- worst of all!
     of aunts and mothers, and the thrall
     of prejudice that's never been
     harboured by maidens of thirteen!
     earnestly striving for persuasion
     How dull are acting and evasion,
     and always the self-same objection;
     how dull to work for the correction
     threats, vows, and simulated fears,
     by six-page letters, rings and tears,

        IX

     Spoilt by the habit of indulgence,
     now dazzled by one thing's effulgence,
     From his first youth he'd known the force,
     bored by success' giddy trifle,
     found that in laughter yawns could stifle:
     and wasted life's fine flower meanwhile.
     he killed eight years in such a style,
     its winds had blown him far off course.
     he heard in stillness and in din
     a deathless murmur from within,
     Evgeny thought in just this fashion.
     the sufferings of tempestuous passion;
     now disenchanted with the next,
     more and more bored by yearning's text,
     {110}

        X

     scarcely recalled their love, their spite;
     He followed them without illusion,
     lost them without regret's contusion,
     rebuffed, found instant consolation;
     Though belles had lost his adoration,
     that self-same evening where he'd go.
     just like a casual guest who might
     he danced attendance with the best;
     deceived, was overjoyed to rest.
     and in the morning wouldn't know
     who'd sit, and at the end of play
     would say goodbye and drive away,
     go off to sleep quite hale and hearty,
     devote to whist an evening party,

     on Eugene, he was deeply stirred:
     But to the garden, to the scene
     where Tanya now confronts Eugene.
     and though perhaps old fires were thrusting
     a soul so innocent, so trusting.
     of a delicious, guiltless dream...
     all plunged his soul deep in the stream
     her look, so sweetly sorrow-laden,
     the flower-like pallor of the maiden,
     that virgin dream and its confession
     Yet Tanya's note made its impression
     Eugene had no wish to betray
     and held him briefly in their sway,

     I leave the verdict in your hand.

     without a word Tatyana leant

     Books, riding, walks, sleep heavy-laden,

     and tedious means to festive ends.

     his beasts outdoors at dawn, nor ringing
     while in the hut a girl is singing;
     the horse gets wind of them and, snorting,
     sets the wise traveller cavorting
     Dawn comes in mist and chill; no longer
     in pairs, their hunger driving stronger,
     the matchwood chatters as it lights.
     she spins and, friend of winter nights,
     on the highroad the wolves come out;

     their joyous way across the ice;
     boy-tribes with skates on loudly slice
     in stars upon the river-brink.
     first flakes of snow whirl round and sink
     a red-foot goose, weight something fearful,
     and skids and tumbles down; the cheerful
     already silvering all the plain...
     here, seize it quick for this quatrain!)

     Or, in your lonely homestead, moping,
     up your accounts, and raging, toping,
     in triumph you'll see winter through!
     Walking? The country that you roam
     is a compulsive bore by reason
     In backwoods, how d'you pass this season?
     let evening pass, tomorrow too --
     and, any moment, down he'll slip.
     will find the ice elude his grip
     to pass the evening. No? then tot

     before the fire a table's spread;
     billiards are dropped, cue put to bed:
     Vladimir Lensky. Quick, let's dine!
     with three roan horses in a line
     he wakes; a bath where ice is floating;
     Childe-Harold-like, Eugene's devoting
     Evgeny waits: and here comes driving,
     then, country evening fast arriving,
     at two-ball billiards prove his skill;
     from early morning on he will
     alone, and sunk in calculation,
     with a blunt cue for the duration,
     and then, indoors the livelong day,
     his hours to dreaming them away:

     how many follies were engendered;
     friends, recollect how I surrendered
     once, with its foaming and its playing,
     Bubbles like Hippocrene are spraying;
     recall, by its bewitching cup,
     my last poor lepton for a sup!
     how many lines of verse, and themes
     for jokes, and rows, and merry dreams!
     (a simile of this and that)
     it held me captive; tit for tat,
     in frosted bottle, for the poet
     From widow Clicquot and from Moët,

     a true companion to the end,
     Bordeaux, you're like a faithful friend,
     perfidious blow to my inside,
     that I prefer to Champagne's tide;
     lively, capricious, and inane...
     But in misfortune or displeasure,
     ready to share our quiet leisure
     I find myself no longer equal;

     long life to our dear friend, Bordeaux!

     Still on the board, the beakers hissed,

     and evening now drew on in mist...
     The fire was dying; cinders faintly
     tumbled and whirled and twisted quaintly

     no notice of them. But I've chattered
     if you come with me, they'll be flattered;
     ``Tell me, our neighbours, are they thriving?
     your dashing one, is she surviving?''
     so much, I'm left no time to speak!
     of course! you're bidden there next week.''
     or else, my friend, how does it look?
     you called there twice, and since then took
     ``Just half a glass more... that will do...
     and how's Tatyana? Olga too,
     What breasts! What soul!... We'll go one day
     visit the family, what d'you say?
     Take Olga's shoulders now -- the beauty!
     All flourishing; they send their duty.

        XLIX

     He drained his glass down to the end
     ``All right, I'll come then...'' ``What a friend!''
     ``But there'll be such a rout and scrabble
     with every different kind of rabble...''
     of Olga: love's that kind of bore!
     then he began to talk once more
     ``No, no, I'm sure the party's small.

     It's right and proper that you went.''

     rapture was just two weeks ahead;
     his transports, and the marriage-bed
     Lensky rejoiced. His designated
     love's crown, delectable, awaited
     I can see naught, as Hymen's foe,
     in all its mystery. Hymen's teasing,
     the pain, the grief, the marrow-freezing
     were from his vision quite withdrawn.
     onset of the incipient yawn,
     While under the connubial banner
     a novel in Lafontaine's8 manner...
     my wretched Lensky in his heart
     was just created for the part.

     the sober head, detesting each
     human reaction, every speech
     like a drunk traveller in a shelter,
     cold reason, sleep in sensual welter
     And he was loved... at least he never
     Happy a hundredfold, whoever
     doubted of it, so lived in bliss.

          thou, my Svetlana!
          O, never know these frightful dreams,

        I

     had with its brilliant mantle crowned --
     That year the season was belated
     expecting winter, nature waited --
     and glittering whiteness all around.
     roofs, flowerbeds, fences, all in white,
     night of the second, started flaking.
     Next day Tatyana, early waking,
     panes patterned by the finest printer,
     and hills that delicately winter
     saw through the window, morning-bright,
     with trees decked in their silvery kit,
     and jolly magpies on the flit,
     and autumn lingered, long and slow;
     only in January the snow,
     {132}

        II

     Winter!... The countryman, enchanted,
     his nag has smelt the snow, and planted
     becomes a horse for all to see;
     his pup to grace the sledge, while he
     his mother taps the window-pane.
     a saucy kibítka is slicing
     its furrow through the powdery icing;
     breaks a new passage with his sleigh;
     the driver sits and cuts a dash
     in sheepskin coat with scarlet sash.
     Here comes the yard-boy, who has chosen
     the rogue has got a finger frozen:
     it hurts, he laughs, and all in vain
     a shambling hoof along the way;

     has something low and unrefined.
     nor his,2 who sings of Finland's maid.
     in any picture of this kind:
     just now of wrestling with his shade,
     secret sledge-rides in verse of fire;
     he'll take you prisoner, you'll admire
     Fired by the god of inspiration,
     another bard1 in exaltation
     for nature's unadorned reaction
     But you perhaps find no attraction
     but I've not got the least intention
     he'll charm you with his fine invention,
     with each nuance of wintry glow:

     with the pink glow the snows assume
     would on those evenings guess the fate
     maid-servants from the whole estate
     Tanya (profoundly Russian being,
     in Russian winters thrilled at seeing
     and festal evenings in the gloom.
     at soldier-husbands, and the drum.
     The Larins kept the old tradition:
     of the two girls; their premonition
     hoar-frost and sun in freezing weather,
     sledges, and tardy dawns together
     herself not knowing how or why)
     the cold perfection of the sky,

     was by forebodings much oppressed.
     The tomcat, mannered and affected,
     that visitors must be expected.
     and washed its face, to her brought word
     the new moon, horned, on her left side,
     Omens dismayed her with their presage;
     each object held a secret message
     and portents of the lunar phase.
     in dreams and cards and their prediction,
     Tatyana shared with full conviction
     the simple faith of olden days
     for her instruction, and her breast
     {134}

        VI

     And if she happened anywhere
     to meet a black monk, or if crossing
     would leave her dithering and tossing.
     already she'd assume ill-luck.
     By dire presentiment awestruck,
     would fill Tatyana from afar
     In the dark sky, a shooting star
     that fell, and then began to shiver,
     her face would pale, she'd start to quiver.
     to whisper it her inmost prayer.
     her path a hare in headlong flight
     ran through the fields, sheer panic fright
     with perturbation and with worry;
     and while the star still flew, she'd hurry

        VII

     Yet -- fear itself she found presented
     our disposition being invented
     a hidden beauty in the end:
     by nature, contradiction's friend.
     no matter: hope, in child's disguise,
     and all is lost beyond retrieving;
     lies bright, and vast beyond perceiving;
     although it's nearly heard the knell,
     spectacled age divines as well,
     is there to lisp its pack of lies.
     Christmas came on. What joy, what gladness!
     Yes, youth divines, in giddy madness,
     youth which has nothing to regret,
     before which life's horizon yet

     from dish of water, rings are shifted
     in due succession; hers is lifted
     and those we sing for will be paid
     they heap up silver with a spade;
     foretells for her some wondrous role;
     and at the very self-same time
     the girls sing out the ancient rhyme:
     Tatyana looks with pulses racing
     beyond a doubt, its wondrous tracing
     ``The peasants there have wealth abounding,
     in goods and fame!'' But the sad-sounding
     at sunken wax inside a bowl:
     ditty portends a loss; more dear
     is ``Kit''3 to every maiden's ear.

        IX

     in a melodious, flute-like tone.
     a passer-by; and on tiptoe
     Tatyana in low-cut attire
     the heavenly lights in glorious quire
     and ``what's your name?'' she asks him, speaking
     is sad old moon's... Hark! snow is creaking...
     tread the calm, settled path they've chosen...
     The sky is clear, the earth is frozen;
     He looks, and answers: ``Agafon.''4
     she flies as fast as she can go;
     and trains a mirror till it faces
     goes out into the courtyard spaces
     the moon; but in the darkened glass
     the only face to shake and pass
     {136}

        X

     I too -- when I recall Svetlana5
     then sudden fear attacked Tatyana...
     Lel6 floats about above her head;
     Tanya's undressed, and lies in bed.
     I'm terrified -- so let it be...
     Prepared for prophecy and fable,
     and in the bath-house had a table
     Tatyana's rites are not for me.
     she did what nurse advised she do
     that night, in secret, set for two;
     a young girl's looking-glass is kept.
     Now all was still. Tatyana slept.
     She's dropped her sash's silken billow;
     and underneath her downy pillow

        XI

     a flood on which no frosty band
     had been imposed by winter's hand;
     she stopped at the loud torrent's bound,
     perplexed... and rooted to the ground.
     were placed across the gulf to make
     a flimsy bridge whose every quake
     She dreamt of portents. In her dreaming
     through gloom and mist; and there came streaming
     she walked across a snowy plain
     a furious, boiling, heaving main
     two poles that ice had glued like plaster
     spelt hazard, ruin and disaster;
     across the drift-encumbered acres,
     a raging torrent, capped with breakers,
     {137}

        XII

     the bear -- what next? -- behind her stalked.
     her way; she passed, then as she walked
     but suddenly a snowdrift rumbled,
     and what came out? a hairy, tumbled,
     enormous bear; Tatyana yelled,
     the bear let out a roar, and held
     to help her from the other side;
     Tatyana groaned above the tide;
     a sharp-nailed paw towards her; bracing
     above the water started tracing
     As if before some mournful parting
     she saw no friendly figure starting
     her nerves, she leant on it her weight,
     and with a halting, trembling gait

        XIII

     the nightly luminaries climb.
     with tufts of snow; and through the lifted
     No path to see: the snow has drifted
     she can't escape at any pace --
     she speeds her footsteps to a race,
     summits of aspen, birch and lime,
     the branches all are weighted down
     in the full beauty of its frown;
     and all the world is buried deep.
     across each bush, across each steep,
     A backward look is fraught with danger;
     but from her shaggy-liveried ranger
     the odious bear still grunts and lumbers.
     Ahead of them a pinewood slumbers
     {138}

        XIV

     her darling foot of its wet shoe,
     her fingers shake, she doesn't dare
     her golden earrings off and whipping;
     and now the crunchy snow is stripping
     no time to pick it up -- she's dying
     to lift her skirt up; still she's flying,
     and he pursuing, till at length
     she flies no more, she's lost her strength.
     her handkerchief has fallen too;
     with fright, she hears the approaching bear;
     She's in the wood, the bear still trails her.
     now a protruding branch assails her
     There's powdery snow up to her knees;
     and clasps her neck; and now she sees

        XV

     in darkest forest depths and drowned
     by dreary snowdrifts piled around;
     the bear explains: ``my cousin's here --
     come in and warm yourself a minute!''
     he whirls her through the wood... a hovel
     shows up through trees, all of a grovel
     and from within come noise and cheer;
     he carries her inside the door
     and sets her gently on the floor.
     the bear has raised her in his paws;
     no move she makes, no breath she draws;
     there's a small window shining in it,
     She's fallen in the snow -- alertly
     and she, submissively, inertly --
     {139}

        XVI

     bear's gone; a hallway, no mistake;
     and shouts suggest a crowded wake;
     a skeleton jerked by a cable,
     a group of monsters round a table,
     a hybrid cross of cat and crane.
     a dog with horns, a goatee'd witch,
     a rooster head, and on the twitch
     she peers discreetly through a chink
     and sees... whatever do you think?
     a dwarf with tail, and a half-strain,
     so, seeing there no rhyme or reason,
     no meaning in or out of season,
     behind the door the clash of glasses
     Tatyana looks, her faintness passes:

        XVII

     the man she feared and idolized --
     among the guests she recognized
     he eyes the door, looks slyly through.
     a crayfish rides on spider-back;
     and swaggers in a red calpack;
     But how she jumped, when in this hovel
     who else? -- the hero of our novel!
     But ever stranger and more fearful:
     on goose's neck, a skull looks cheerful
     Onegin sits at table too,
     song, laughter, whistle, bark and champ,
     and human words, and horse's stamp!
     with bended knees a windmill dances,
     its sails go flap-flap as it prances;
     {140}

        XVIII

     he's host, that's obvious. Thus enlightened
     Tanya's no longer quite so frightened
     of house-familiars stands dismayed...
     puts out the lamps; the whole brigade
     he laughs -- they all begin to chuckle;
     He nods -- they start to fuss and truckle;
     he scowls -- and the whole gang are still;
     he drinks -- all shout and take a swill;
     all stand. He walks towards the door.
     from table, clattering on the floor;
     with eyes aflame Onegin rises
     but then a sudden breeze surprises,
     and, curious now about the lot,
     opens the door a tiny slot...

        XIX

     Wildly the fearful laughter pealed;
     monsters the maiden stood revealed.
     all point at her, and all combine
     to bellow out: ``she's mine, she's mine.''
     and to the vision of those mortal
     she can't; Evgeny's pushed the portal,
     the horns, and the moustachio'd nozzles --
     the eyes of all, the hooves, the snozzles,
     the tusks, the corpse's finger-nails,
     the bleeding tongues, the tufted tails,
     she flails around, she tries to shout --
     Tatyana struggles to run out --
     Now she's alarmed; in desperate worry
     she can't; and in her panic hurry
     {141}

        XX

     Olga's appeared upon the scene,
     and Lensky follows her... Eugene,
     his head upon her shoulder... blaze
     the girl remains there in the gloom
     clears in a flash the freezing room;
     ``She's mine!'' Evgeny's voice of thunder
     the whole thieves' kitchen flies asunder,
     into a corner, gently makes her
     alone with him; Onegin takes her
     and almost swoons, and almost dies.
     damns the intruders; Tanya lies
     of sudden brightness... it's too curious...
     eyes rolling, arms uplifted, furious,
     sit on a flimsy bench, and lays

        XXI

     play on the window's frosted lace;
     in through the door, at swallow's pace,
     Louder and louder sounds the wrangle:
     a carving-knife -- and in the tangle
     and growing thicker; then, heart-shaking,
     a scream rings out... the cabin's quaking...
     pinker than glow of Northern morning,
     outside, the scarlet rays of dawning
     Lensky's thrown down. The murk is thick
     Eugene has caught up, quick as quick,
     she looks, the room is getting light --
     Tanya comes to in utter fright...
     who was it that you dreamt about?''
     flits Olga: ``now, tell me straight out,
     {142}

        XXII

     and kept quite silent while she read.
     Tatyana simply lay in bed,
     no one was ever so engrossed:
     no brilliant truth, no vivid scene;
     and yet by Vergil or Racine
     arch-commentator of the dream.
     dean of Chaldea's learned team,
     Martin Zadéka was the siren,
     devoured a book with rapt attention,
     Deaf to her sister's intervention,
     by Scott, by Seneca, or Byron,
     no magic fancies of the poet,
     The book displayed, not so you'd know it,
     even by Ladies' Fashion Post,

        XXIII

     swapped it for odd tomes of Malvina,
     a grammar, a digest of fable,
     bewitches Tanya... he is able
     and every night shares her repose.
     and took two Petriads in calf,
     he charged three roubles and a half,
     This work of the profoundest learning
     one day came down that lonely turning,
     and to Tanya, when he was through,
     and volume three of Marmontel.
     Since then Martin Zadéka's spell
     was brought there by a huckster who
     but just to make the bargain keener,
     to comfort her in all her woes,
     {143}

        XXIV

     she finds, in order alphabetic:
     Searching the table exegetic
     For several days she peaked and pined
     Martin Zadéka fails to mend;
     the horrid nightmare must portend
     in deep anxiety of mind.
     to puzzle out with some precision
     Tatyana's haunted by her vision,
     etcetera. But her trepidation
     a hideous deal of tribulation.
     just what the nightmare signifies.
     plagued by her ghastly dream, and tries
     fir, forest, hedgehog, raven, snow
     bear, blackness, blizzard, bridge and crow,

        XXV

     there's yap of pugs, and laughs, and bustle;
     The hall is full of noise and hustle,
     Since dawn, whole families have been driving
     towards the Larins' and arriving
     the threshold's thronged, wet-nurses call,
     guests bow, feet scrape, and children squall.
     the festal name day has begun.
     from daybreak valleys lift the sun;
     in britzkas, kibítkas and sleighs.
     in sledded coaches and coupés,
     But now Aurora's crimson fingers
     the morning light no longer lingers,
     in the salon new faces meet,
     and kisses smack as young girls greet;
     {144}

        XXVI

     in a peaked cap, all dust and fluff, --
     you'll recognize him soon enough, --
     whose serfs are miserably thin;
     fat Pústyakov has driven in;
     bribe-taker, glutton and buffoon.
     that rogue, backbiter, pantaloon,
     here's Petushkóv, the local fop;
     from thirty down to two; and stop,
     Gvozdín, exemplary farmer,
     Here with his wife, that bulging charmer,
     with broods of children of all ages,
     and the Skotínins, grizzled sages,
     and counsellor (retired) Flyánov,
     and look, my cousin's come, Buyánov,

     and for belle Nina, as it read,
     he's put belle Tatiana instead.

     ``réveillez-vous, belle endormie.''
     He found them in some old collection,
     to undertake their resurrection,
     Triquet, ingenious poet, dares
     addressed to Tanya, certain verses
     inside a pocket Triquet nurses,
     Here, in his red peruke and glasses,
     has come with Kharlikov; he passes
     printed among outmoded airs;
     late of Tambov, Monsieur Triquet
     for witty; in his Gallic way

     the men confront them, face to face:
     they sit, they cross themselves for grace.
     the Major's here: he's all the rage
     with demoiselles of riper age;
     his news has set the party humming!
     the regimental band is coming,
     and arm in arm they all go through;
     with our Mamas, and a sensation
     And from the nearby Army station
     But dinner's served, so two by two
     Young ladies jump for future blisses...
     round Tanya congregate the misses,
     sent at the Colonel's own behest.
     A ball: the joy of every guest!

        XXIX

     the crash of plates and knives is blended
     They buzz -- but then all talk's suspended --
     among the guests a general dinning:
     And now there's gradually beginning
     none listens when the others speak,
     all shout and argue, laugh and squeak.
     they shove each plate, and every chair,
     and shout, and make room for the pair.
     the guests squeeze closer to the centres;
     Then doors are opened, Lensky enters,
     with the resounding chime of glass.
     jaws masticate as minutes pass:
     the hostess cries and, moving fast,
     Onegin too. ``Good Lord, at last!''

     came out so soft, it scarce was heard.
     she sat there; through her teeth a word
     she's nearly swooned, she's suffocating;
     From violent passions fast pulsating
     Just facing Tanya's where they're sitting;
     she lowers darkened eyes, unwitting,
     and paler than the moon at dawn,
     and trembles like a hunted fawn.
     the friends' salute she never hears
     and from her eyes the eager tears
     poor girl, to drop into a faint,
     but will, and reason's strong constraint,
     are almost bursting; she's quite ready,
     prevailed, and with composure steady

     he watched the guests and, as he dined,
     caricatured them in his mind.
     he knew too well that sort of scene.
     girls' tears, their swooning, for Eugene
     the best revenge one could desire.
     to wreak, by stirring Lensky's ire,
     looked down in an access of hate,
     He saw the sad girl's trembling state,
     Now, faced with this enormous revel,
     he'd got annoyed, the tricky devil.
     Already, in exultant fashion,
     pouted, and swore in furious passion
     The nervous-tragical reaction,
     had long proved tedious to distraction:
     {147}

     that moment, of a luscious pie
     not only by Evgeny's eye;
     bottles to which some pitch is clinging:
     (alas, too salted); now they're bringing
     you made me drunk as one could ask!
     with draughts from love's enticing flask,
     Zizi, my crystal and my gem,
     how they remind me of your stem,
     but looks and talk took the direction,
     Tanya's distress had risked detection
     of goblets, tall and slender pretties;
     you object of my guileless ditties!
     Tsimlyansky wine, between the meat
     and the blancmanger, then a fleet

        XXXIII

     Freed from its dripping cork, the bottle
     solemn, too long compelled to throttle
     Triquet sings, out of tune. Loud clapping
     great bard despite his modest trapping,
     then he presents her with the scroll.
     he's first to toast her in the bowl,
     of swooning, Tanya nearly dies;
     and, scroll in hand, before her eyes
     the party waits. Seized with an illness
     is on his feet -- in utter stillness
     his itching verse, Monsieur Triquet
     thank him by curtseying to the dust;
     and cheers salute him. Tanya must
     explodes; wine fizzes up... but stay:

     or half-unwittingly preferred
     it was that he'd been truly stirred,
     there was a softness in his glance:
     it brought back Tanya from her trance.
     Tanya thanks each one with a phrase.
     arrives, the girl's exhausted gaze,
     her discomposure, her confusion,
     expose his soul to an intrusion
     Compliment and congratulation;
     When Eugene's turn for salutation
     a joking flirt, or both together,
     a wondrous tenderness. And whether
     of pity: in his silent bow,
     and in his look there shows somehow

        XXXV

     pursuits of a monotonous breed
     begot by boredom out of greed.
     the eager players are enrolled --
     and whist, that's now so keenly fêted --
     now, by green tablecloths awaited,
     Boston and ombre for the old,
     and all into the salon squeeze,
     Chairs are pushed outward, loudly rumbling,
     as from their luscious hive go tumbling
     neighbours in high content are wheezing;
     The banquet's given no cause for sneezing,
     ladies at the fireside confer,
     in corners whispering girls concur;
     fieldward, in noisy swarm, the bees.

     whom thirty centuries have adored!
     they've moved around and been reseated;
     By now whist's heroes have completed
     as yours did, Homer, godlike lord,
     and eatables beyond all classing
     of any Bréguet: and in passing
     I'll just remark, my verses talk
     as much of banquets and the cork
     I like to tell the time by dinner
     and tea and supper; there's an inner
     no fuss; our belly has the power
     clock in the country rings the hour;
     and tea's brought in. Instead of chimes
     eight rubbers; and by now eight times

     your Zeus, your Cypris, your whole band
     have clearly got the upper hand
     of plains where boredom reigns complete,

     At feasts, though, full of pert aggression,
     and all our modish education;
     of Eugene, cold as all creation,
     no, Tanya's more endearing far.
     but your vile Helen's not my star --
     your heroes, raging and ferocious,
     your battles, lawless and atrocious,

     I put your genius to the test,

     around Priam the much-respected,
     though Menelaus, in Helen's name,

     be good enough to go on reading:

     No one will think that worth gainsaying,

     Buyánov whirls off Pustyakova;
     Tatyana on; Miss Kharlikova,
     approaches Olga; Lensky's signed
     his tea with rum quite left behind,
     that nubile maid of riper age,
     is seized by Tambov's poet-sage;
     Petushkóv, local Paris, tearing,
     Elated by the music's blaring,
     and in full brilliance shines the ball.
     they all have swarmed into the hall,
     Here's tea: the girls have just, as bidden,
     when, from behind the doorway, hidden
     taken the saucers in their grip,
     bassoons and flutes begin to trip.

     to my young days, it's time I turned
     (if you'll turn back to chapter one)
     Enough I've wandered in the suite
     in this fifth chapter of my work.
     let no more such digressions lurk
     and charming reverie's vain deflection
     absorbed me in the recollection
     to demonstrate some signs of reason:
     of your slim prints! though this be treason
     a ball in Petersburg; but fun
     of certain ladies' tiny feet.
     I meant to paint, with Alban's8 glory,
     Right at the outset of my story

     past all the assembly in a whirl,
     to talk of this and that, but then
     after two minutes, off again,
     Revenge's hour is near, and after
     Evgeny, full of inward laughter,
     All are dumbfounded. Lensky shies
     away from trusting his own eyes.
     like mindless youth, the waltz goes by
     as pair by pair the dancers fly.

     now things are changed, now we resemble
     our modern Russia's plague and bane.
     used in times past to ring a peal
     while floors would split from crash of heel,
     are here untouched by fashion's reign,
     that huge ballrooms vibrated under,
     Now the mazurka sounds. Its thunder
     in country towns and suchlike places
     as fresh as ever, for its graces
     its pristine charm: heeltaps, and leaps,
     and whiskers -- all of this it keeps
     ladies who glide on waxed parquet.
     Yet the mazurka keeps today

     < Petushkóv's nails and spurs are sounding
     they're plunging, whirling, all but squatting.
     there's crashing, rumbling, pounding, trotting,

     your heels will squash the ladies' toes! >

     Lensky has watched: his rage has blazed,
     he's lost his self-command, and crazed
     Eugene takes Olga, and is gone;
     on her smug face a flush of pleasure.
     with jealousy beyond all measure
     he stoops and, tenderly confiding,
     he steers her, nonchalantly gliding,
     to Eugene; nineteen to the dozen,
     Buyánov, my vivacious cousin,
     leads Olga and Tatyana on
     squeezes her hand -- and brings to flower
     whispers some ballad of the hour,
     insists, when the mazurka ends,
     on the cotillion, as amends.

     How could she? why, he'd never heard...
     No, she's already pledged her word
     scarce out of bibs, already fickle,
     fresh from the cot, an infant pickle,
     he leaves the house, calls for his horse
     so, cursing women's devious course,
     already high in treason's league!
     already studying to intrigue,
     He finds the shock beyond all bearing:
     and gallops. Pistols made for pairing
     to Evgeny. Oh, God, she'd never...
     He asks. She can't accept. Why ever?
     and just a double charge of shot
     will in a flash decide his lot.

     A new acquaintance claims our quill.
     so, if we want to change, we can!
     and even honourable man:
     of philosophic isolation,

     unswerving friend, correct landowner,

     into the mud, a drunken goner,
     true, with a pistol he could shatter

     or cause the bursting of his bubble,
     Sometimes his tricks would earn him trouble,
     and put them on a paced-out site.
     But he could draw a joking moral,
     or cunningly create a quarrel,
     return an answer, blunt or keen,
     use cunning silence as a screen,
     himself just like a simple chap.
     sometimes he'd fall into a trap
     so gloriously he'd fool the clever,
     Time was, he'd been the wittiest ever,
     using overt or covert rules.
     so brilliantly he'd hoax the fools,
     get two young friends to pick a fight,

     with lies and jokes that packed a punch:
     (like passion's dream, that other revel)
     sed alia tempora! The devil
     and teaching children how to spell.
     and breeding ducks and geese as well,
     Or he knew how to reconcile them
     then later slyly he'd revile them
     beneath bird-cherries and acacias
     for planting cabbage, like Horatius,

     but for the effect that he created
     He was no fool; appreciated

     his converse gave Onegin pleasure;
     so it was not in any measure,
     the morning after, a surprise
     His visitor from the beginning
     Zaretsky watched, and stood there grinning.
     crossed to the window, read it through.
     a note from Lensky; in between
     Onegin without more ado
     when our Zaretsky met his eyes.
     by my Eugene, not for his heart,
     of sense and judgement. For his part

        IX

     he informed this envoy diplomatic
     Eugene's response was automatic;
     at any time he'd be prepared.
     in terms where not a word was spared:
     that, though polite, was clear as ice.
     was far from happy with his role.
     with work at home; but when he'd gone,
     gentlemanly, quite precise,
     left quite alone with his own soul,
     he saw no point in staying on,
     Pleasant, in spite of its compression,
     Vladimir's challenge found expression
     Evgeny, whom the repercussion
     Zaretsky rose without discussion;
     {159}

        X

     he found too much that he regretted:
     With reason, too: for when he'd vetted
     no boy, to fight or take offence --
     of love so timorous and gentle.
     in secret judgement what he'd done,
     the man of honour and of sense.
     so heartless and so detrimental,
     no softball for the winds of fashion,
     at eighteen years, to some compassion.
     last night he'd erred in making fun,
     In second place the poet might
     have been a fool; yet he'd a right,
     Evgeny loved him from his heart,
     and should have played a different part:

        XI

     True, scorn should punish and should bridle
     He could have spoken without harming,
     he should have settled for disarming
     Public opinion -- here's our idol,
     the spring of honour, and the pin
     on which the world is doomed to spin.
     it's late, time's passing... not to mention,
     in our affair, the intervention
     his wit, according to the rules
     but whispers, the guffaw of fools...''
     need not have bristled like a beast;
     that youthful heart. ``But now at least
     that wicked, loose-tongue chatterbox...
     of that old duellistic fox,

     The jealous poet's gloom is lightened!
     knowing the offender, he'd been frightened
     impatient, hatred flaming high;
     avert his chest from pistol's click,
     lest he should by some clever trick
     early tomorrow at the mill
     But now Vladimir's doubts are still:
     to hit the target: thigh or brain.
     to raise the safety catch and strain
     but here comes our loud-talking prancer
     Lensky at home awaits the answer,
     before first light they have appointment,
     smoothe his way out with humour's ointment.
     who swaggers in with the reply.

        XIII

     to meet the unhappy poet, skipped
     just as she'd always been, she tripped
     struck down as if she'd been accused,
     He thought that Olga'd be confused,
     and set on hating the coquette,
     Lensky resolved before the duel
     Still blazing with resentment's fuel,
     watched sun and clock -- then by such labours
     defeated, turned up at his neighbour's.
     not to see Olga; in a fret
     down from the porch, light as the lightest,
     when he arrived; not in the slightest:
     the same as any other day.
     the giddiest hope, carefree and gay,
     {161}

        XIV

     and silently he hung his head.
     was the first thing that Olga said.
     such frank tendresse; away they stole
     he trembles, knows not what to tell;
     he's happy, yes, he's almost well...
     before such playfulness of soul!...
     before such candour of expression,
     Rage died, and jealousy's obsession,
     he almost begs for absolution,
     he looks, in sweet irresolution,
     Already borne down by regret,
     and then concludes: she loves him yet!
     ``Last night, what made you fly so early?''
     All Lensky's thoughts went hurly-burly,

        (XV, XVI,2) XVII

     of sighs, and compliments, and fire;
     her youth with all his repertoire
     Friends, all this meant was: I've a date
     for swapping bullets with my mate.
     still hardly opened up, from fading.''
     that poisonous worm, despised, degrading,
     I'll stop that tempter from depraving
     he murmurs: ``Olga's mine for saving;
     and so he lacks the strength to mention
     Now brooding thoughts hold his attention
     the happenings of the previous night;
     once more, at that beloved sight,
     I'll save this blossom on the shoot,
     shall not attack my lily's root;

     perhaps her love could in the end
     have reunited friend to friend!
     of the whole world, her nurse alone,
     If Tanya'd had the chance of learning
     would settle, on the morrow morning,
     If only Lensky'd known the burning
     for which of them the tomb was yawning,
     Tatyana pined in secret fashion:
     But, even by accident, her passion
     if not slow-witted, might have known.
     wound that had seared my Tanya's heart!
     that Lensky and Eugene, apart,

     parting with Olga made him think
     the heart inside him seemed to shrink;
     the quintessential reaction
     Lensky all evening, in distraction,
     of Muses' offspring; sitting down
     would talk, keep silent, laugh, then frown --
     ``I think I'm happy.'' Time to go,
     She faced him, questioning: ``But you?...''
     ``It's nothing.'' And away he flew.
     to Olga's face, he whispered low

     undressed, by candlelight selected
     Once home, he brought out and inspected
     in untold beauty close at hand.
     Olga is there, he sees her stand
     and opened Schiller... but the embrace
     his pistols, laid them in their case,
     prepares himself; and then his verse,
     compact of amorous trash, and worse,
     of one sole thought holds him in keeping
     and stops his doleful heart from sleeping:
     flows and reverberates. Reciting,
     Vladimir shuts the book, for writing
     like Delvig3 when he's dining drunk.
     he sounds, in lyric frenzy sunk,

     blessed are daytime's care and cark,
     blest is the advent of the dark!
     my golden days when spring was dear?

     Whether the arrow has my number,

     At last, with dawn upon him, stooping
     its due oblivion, in the hush
     his neighbour entered at a rush
     over the modish word ideal,

     (in the romantic style, we say,
     fail to perceive -- that's by the way).

     At last he wakes, and stirs in bed,
     By now the shades of night are flying,
     But he's mistaken: Eugene's lying
     Vesper is met by crow of cock --
     and sleeping sounder than a rock.
     but Eugene hasn't moved; for certain
     and parts the fringes of his curtain;
     glitter and tumble as they go,
     and little dancing whirls of snow
     he looks, and sees the hour of day --
     high time he should be on his way.

     amazement: ``Where's your second gone?''
     (for which he must receive due praise).
     While Lensky'd long been meditating
     Zaretsky, engineer-in-waiting,
     impatiently on the mill-dam,
     condemned the millstones as a sham.
     In duels a pedantic don,
     only by rule, and strict tradition
     methodical by disposition,
     but in Zaretsky he induces
     Onegin comes, and makes excuses;
     inherited from earlier days

     a classicist, he'll not allow

        XXVII

     I had most surely never reckoned
     his choice could shock or might offend;
     He's here -- Monsieur Guillot, my friend.
     Evgeny echoed him: ``My second?
     Zaretsky bit his lip. Eugene

     replies: ``We might as well.'' They walk
     asked Lensky: ``Should we start, I mean?''

     Zaretsky draws up a convention
     though he's unknown, there's no suggestion
     that he's not honest past all question.''

     all modish foes dread worldly shame.
     and part in kindness? Just the same,
     could they not laugh out loud, before
     their hands are dipped in scarlet gore,
     But now, in this vindictive pleasure
     their table, and their hours of leisure?
     and as in some appalling dream
     hereditary foes they seem,
     Foes! Is it long since from each other
     long since, like brother linked to brother,
     each coldly plans the other's slaughter...
     could they not give each other quarter
     they shared their days in deed and heart,
     the lust for blood drew them apart?

        XXIX

     with a first click, the catch is tried.
     each grips his pistol in his hand.
     and on their marks has made them stand;
     thumps as the balls are pressed inside
     their cloaks; Zaretsky's measured off
     And now the two opponents doff
     Now powder's greyish stream is slipping
     into the pan. Securely gripping,
     stands in dismay and indecision.
     thirty-two steps with great precision,
     Pistols are out, they gleam, the hammer
     faceted muzzles by the rammer;
     Guillot, behind a stump in view,
     the jagged flint's pulled back anew.
     {168}

        XXX

     but just then Eugene's pistol flamed...
     and Lensky, left eye closing, aimed --
     The clock of doom had struck as fated;
     of five more steps they went, slow-gaited,
     let fall his pistol on the ground.
     and the poet, without a sound,
     to aim, at steady, even pace
     each took four steps across the space,
     the foes, cold-blooded and unspeaking,
     ``Now march.'' And calmly, not yet seeking
     the level tenor of his going,
     four fateful stairs. Then, without slowing
     Evgeny quietly began
     to lift his pistol up. A span

     the youthful votary of rhyme
     to heart. And in his misted gaze
     down slopes of mountains, when a blaze
     is death, not pain. So gently gliding
     Vladimir drops, hand softly sliding
     The storm is over,5 dawn is paling,
     calls out his name... All unavailing:
     the bloom has withered on the bough;
     Onegin, drenched with sudden chill,
     darts to the boy, and looks, and still
     the altar flame's extinguished now.

     The lady of the house has fled.

     and hope and passion; life had glowed
     the blood came smoking from the wound.

     Shot through below the chest -- and streaming

     A moment earlier, inspiration

     but when you've managed his despatch

     his thrusting horns, and as he passes

     right in the flower of joyous hope,
     where's the high aim, the ardent sense
     of youth, so tender, so intense?
     the thirst for work, the lust for learning,
     and where is love's tempestuous yearning,

     his nature would be changed and steadied,
     in quilted dressing-gown adorned,
     and in the country, blissful, horned,
     he would have found a normal fate.
     he'd see his soul cool in its grate;
     The years would pass; no longer youthful,
     Perhaps however, to be truthful,
     life's real meaning would have found him;

     Walking her horse in introspection
     where did that glum eccentric go,
     her heartache, did it long compel her,
     ``Olga,'' she thinks, ``what fate befell her?

     I've learnt new sadness; but in this

     his sweetheart faithful to her grief.
     Alas for him! there was no keeping
     Poor Lensky! Set aside for weeping,
     her thoughts away, knew how to lavish
     Another had the skill to ravish
     a Lancer -- how she deified him!
     already there she stands beside him;
     her head in modesty cast down,
     and at the altar, with a crown,
     and on her lips a light smile plays.

        XI

     Poor Lensky! where the tomb is bounded
     was the sad poet not confounded
     foes, friends and loves, their voice is stilled.
     Or, as by Lethe's bank he slumbered,
     perhaps no more sensations lumbered
     the earth for him grew dumb and closed?...
     the lucky bard, and as he dozed
     beyond the grave we all must build --
     On such indifference, such forgetting
     Only the estate provides a setting
     for angry heirs, as one, to fall
     into an unbecoming brawl.
     by dull eternity's purlieus,
     at this betrayal's fateful news?
     {182}

        XII

     Tatyana went with them, and sped
     the carriage of the newly-wed.
     and in her grief seemed fit to die;
     inside the Larins' house fell mute.
     slave of the service, was en route.
     only the pallor of heart-breaking
     over the business of leave-taking,
     Weltered in tears, and sorely smarting,
     the old dame wept her daughter's parting,
     Back to his regiment the Lancer,
     Presently Olga's ringing answer
     onto the porch, and fussed about
     covered her face. When all came out
     but Tanya found she couldn't cry:

        XIII

     So there she stood, forlorn, deserted!
     And long, as if through mists that spurted,
     Tanya pursued them with her gaze...
     allows no comfort to come through --
     a grain of gladness; tears' repression
     Shade-like, in purposeless obsession
     Tatyana's heart is rent in two.
     had been for ever borne off far
     and parted from her by their star.
     of secrets, like a friend but dearer,
     oh! her young dove, the natural hearer
     The comrade of so many days,
     she roams the empty garden-plot...
     in everything she sees there's not
     {183}

        XIV

     another, and his memory's fled
     by now his bride-to-be has wed
     of far-away Onegin's name.
     now she's bereft, and just the same
     The poet's dead... already though
     She'll not see him, her obligation
     must be to hold in detestation
     Two hearts there are perhaps that keep
     a tear for him... but what's to weep?
     her heart speaks to her even louder
     Her passion burns with stronger powder
     as smoke in azure sky disperses.
     no one recalls him or his verses;
     the man who laid her brother low.

        XV

     profoundly sunk, Tatyana stalked
     for hours alone; she walked and walked...
     in quiet flood. A beetle whirred.
     Beyond the stream there smoked and stirred
     above a stream the moon had lighted.
     Suddenly, from a crest, she sighted
     below a hill; a garden stood
     a house, a village, and a wood
     a fisher's fire. Through country gleaming
     silver with moonlight, in her dreaming
     Evening, and darkening sky, and waters
     The choirs of dancers sought their quarters.
     She looked across, felt in her heart
     a faster, stronger pulsing start.
     {184}

        XVI

     with puzzled and confused regard...
     She entered the deserted yard.
     ``The house, the park... I'll go and see!''
     forward or back? it's true that he
     So down came Tanya, hardly daring
     to draw a breath, around her staring
     by dint of cuff and kick and smack
     they managed to disperse the pack.
     Dogs, howling, rushed in her direction...
     giving the lady their protection,
     has left, and no one here has met her...
     She hesitates, and doubts beset her:
     Her frightened cry brought running out
     the household boys in noisy rout;

        XVII

     ``where master used to sit alone.
     ``And here's the hearth,'' explains the crone,
     on billiard-table rests a cue,
     She looks: forgotten past all chalking
     a riding whip. Tanya keeps walking...
     the keys that opened up the hall.
     Tatyana asked. The children all
     she went inside the empty shell
     in which our hero used to dwell.
     and on the crumpled sofa too
     ``Could I just see the house, I wonder?''
     rushed to Anisia's room, to plunder
     the doorway opened wide to meet her,
     At once Anisia came to greet her,
     {185}

     and rest his dear bones in the tomb,
     down in our damp earth-mother's womb!''
     with neighbour Lensky, the deceased.
     and put his glasses on to see
     his Sunday game of cards with me.
     in morning time he'd read a book...
     And just here, in the window-nook,
     is where old master took up station,
     I pray God grant his soul salvation,
     ``Here in the winter he'd have dinner
     Please follow me. And here's the inner
     on cups of coffee, and then later
     he'd listen to the administrator;
     study where he would sleep and feast

     on which a carpet has been spread,
     beside the window-sill, that bed
     in fashion that's half-glad, half-anguished:
     that table where the lamp has languished,
     where folded arms are tightly pressed.
     it stirs her drooping soul to bound
     gazes at all the scene around;
     piled books, and through the pane the sable
     the iron figure3 on the table,
     moonscape, the half-light overall,
     Lord Byron's portrait on the wall,
     Tatyana in a deep emotion
     she drinks it like a priceless potion;
     the hat, the scowling brow, the chest
     {186}

        XX

     the time to go has long since passed
     and not without a sigh, perforce
     to come back to the hall alone
     sets out upon her homeward course;
     of hills has hid the moon; for certain
     round the dim river sleep; the curtain
     before she goes, she seeks permission
     Tatyana, hiding her condition,
     and read the books there on her own.
     Longtime inside this modish cloister,
     It's late. A breeze begins to roister,
     the valley's dark. The forest lands
     as if spellbound, Tatyana stands.
     for the young pilgrim. So at last

        XXI

     Outside the gate Tatyana parted
     at earliest morning out she started,
     at first she had no heart to range;
     but then she found their choice was strange.
     at last alone, and quite forgetting
     then in the study's quiet setting,
     and watched a different world unroll.
     Tatyana turned with thirsting soul:
     To reading from this odd collection
     the books then underwent inspection...
     and sat there as the minutes crept;
     the world and all its works, she wept
     with old Anisia. The next day
     to the empty homestead made her way,
     {187}

     had ruled out reading, in their place
     a few books had escaped disgrace:
     that soul without a moral tie,
     and still exempted from removal
     Though long since Eugene's disapproval
     epoch's portrayed, survived the ban,
     works where contemporary man
     two or three novels where our later
     Don Juan's and the Giaour's creator,
     and that embittered mind which boils
     in empty deeds and futile toils.
     to dreaming given up unduly,
     is represented rather truly,
     all egoistical and dry,

     had drawn Eugene's especial heed
     and where he'd silently agreed.
     Onegin's soul encountered there
     pursue his pencil. Everywhere
     Her eyes along the margin flitting
     declares itself in ways unwitting --
     terse words or crosses in the book,
     or else a query's wondering hook.
     There many pages keep the impression
     On these, with something like obsession,
     Tatyana sees with trepidation
     what kind of thought, what observation,
     the girl's attentive eyes are bent.
     where a sharp nail has made a dent.
     {188}

        XXIV

     for whom her passion has been planned
     Tanya begins to understand
     And so, at last, feature by feature,
     more thoroughly, thank God, the creature
     whether from heaven or from hell,
     this angel, this proud devil, tell,
     a modish second-hand edition,
     what is he? Just an apparition,
     who walks with sorrow, and with danger,
     by fate's decree: this freakish stranger,
     a shadow, null and meaningless,
     a Muscovite in Harold's dress,
     a glossary of smart argot...
     a parodistic raree-show?

        XXV

     ``why, Olga's younger, and she's bedded.
     always comes back: I'll not be wedded.
     And then she broods and mopes for good,
     and trails alone around the wood.''
     ``Tanya's no child -- it's past a joke,''
     her journey home is overdue.
     is this the riddle's missing clue?
     Time races, and she's been forgetting
     Can she have found the enigma's setting?
     It's time she went. But what can I
     says the old lady in a croak:
     Some neighbours there have come together;
     they talk of her, of how and whether:
     do with her when a flat reply

     There's vacancies in plenty there.''
     far from it! just one more collapse.''
     bestirred himself, was devilish active!
     he found Tatyana so attractive,
     Buyánov tried -- got flea in ear.
     ``She's not in love?'' ``There's no one, ever.
     And Ivan Petushkóv; no, never.
     Moscow's the place, the marriage-fair!
     I thought, she'll go this time, perhaps;
     ``One winter's worth, you've surely got;
     or borrow, say, from me, if not.''
     ``My dear good sir, I'm short of money.''
     ``You don't see what to do? that's funny:

     such good and sensible advice;
     her out-of-fashion turns of phrase,
     where her security's complete.
     of a provincial ingénue,
     parade before their mocking gaze
     The old dame had no thought of scouring
     accounts were done, a winter outing
     Then Tanya hears of the decision.
     To face society's derision
     to expose to Moscow fops and Circes
     her out-of-fashion clothes!... oh, mercies!
     no, forests are the sole retreat
     with the unmistakeable sideview

     my fate, it leads me to what end?''
     whither does all my yearning tend?
     gay nature and its sparkling distance!
     Farewell to you, my free existence!
     for vanity, and din, and glare!...
     into the fields, surveys the morning,
     Risen with earliest rays of dawning,
     beauty with all its heavenly spell,
     Farewell, familiar woods! Farewell,
     This dear, still world I must forswear
     and says: ``Farewell, you vales and fountains!
     farewell you too, familiar mountains!
     with deep emotion looks about
     Tanya today goes hurrying out

     suggests a victim richly decked...
     The north wind blows, the clouds are driving --
     now golden autumn's just arriving.
     she finds in river and in hill.
     Often she halts against her will,
     As with old friends, she craves diversion
     in gossip's rambling and discursion
     arrested by the sheer perfection
     She wanders on without direction.
     with her own forests and her meads...
     But the swift summer-time proceeds --
     Now Nature's tremulous, pale effect
     amidst the howling and the blast
     sorceress-winter's here at last.
     {191}

        XXX

     first snow for shoulders, breast and head:
     for Tanya, winter's ways are dread.
     beneath a shroud that's all dishevelled;
     the bank, the immobile stream are levelled
     she won't inhale the powdered rime,
     for her, no joy from winter-time,
     nor from the bath-house roof be clearing
     Only from Tanya's heart, no cheering --
     the branches of the oak with flock;
     across the fields, round hill and rock;
     lies in a coverlet that ripples
     She's here, she spreads abroad; she stipples
     frost gleams. We watch with gleeful thanks
     old mother winter at her pranks.

        XXXI

     and useful goods of every kind.
     with pots and basins out of mind,
     relined and strengthened for the drive;
     at last the final hours arrive.
     A sledded coach, for years forsaken,
     Departure date's long overtaken;
     three carts -- traditional procession --
     with every sort of home possession:
     with tears, in quarters of the maids:
     and, in the yard, stand eighteen jades.
     and feather-beds, and birds in cages,
     There's din of parting now that rages,
     and jam in jars, and household wares,
     pans, mattresses, and trunks, and chairs,
     {192}

        XXXII

     mountains are piled on every carriage,
     Horses and coach are spliced in marriage;
     of solitude, and peace abiding!
     They're settled in; and crawling, sliding,
     his spindly, shaggy nag. As fitting,
     The bearded outrider is sitting
     the cooks prepare the midday meal;
     and coachmen swear, and women squeal.
     for the two ladies at the gates.
     shall I see you?'' As Tanya speaks
     the tears in stream pour down her cheeks.
     to wave farewell the household waits
     ``Farewell, you realms that own the sway
     the grand barouche is on its way.

        XXXIII

     an inn at each stage of the route.
     Godfearing folk will institute
     audacious tunnels will be marching:
     and iron bridges will go arching
     paved roads will traverse Russia's length
     bringing her unity and strength;
     in time (to quote the calculation
     When progress and amelioration
     mountains will part; below the deep,
     over the waters in a sweep;
     will blossom into splendid highways:
     five hundred years) for sure our byways
     of philosophic brains, about
     have pushed their frontiers further out,

     have gnawed our bridges, and the flea
     of ruts that grace our fatherland.
     and blesses the unrivalled brand
     allow no rest to you or me;
     before a fire too slowly flaming,
     meanwhile the local Cyclops, aiming
     log cabin a pretentious-teasing
     inns don't exist; but in a freezing
     But now our roads are bad, the ages
     and bedbug that infest the stages

     all sorts of hopeless appetites;
     a Russian hammer-blow, repairs

     by flickering past us like a fence.
     and mileposts grip the idle sense
     our troikas effortlessly dashing,
     Then our Automedons are flashing,
     of traveller's tedium at its peak:
     their journey took them a full week.
     Like modish rhymes that lack all reason,
     By contrast, in the frozen season,
     the winter's ways are smooth as glass.
     how pleasantly the stages pass.
     and gave our heroine enjoyment
     Worse luck, Larina crawled; the employment
     spared her the expense she dreaded most --
     of her own horses, not the post,

     before their eyes they see unfold
     with fire from every cross of gold.
     Friends, how my heart would leap with pleasure
     when suddenly I saw this treasure
     the towers of whitestone Moscow beaming
     But now they're near. Already gleaming
     Moscow... how many strains are fusing
     How often would I fall to musing
     of spires and belfries, in a cup
     with parks and mansions, open up.
     in that one sound, for Russian hearts!
     what store of riches it imparts!
     of Moscow in the mournful days
     of absence on my wandering ways!

        XXXVII

     in which so lately it abounded
     Here stands, with shady park surrounded,
     the impatient conqueror was humbled!
     but no, my Moscow never stumbled
     Napoleon here, intoxicated
     with recent fortune, vainly waited
     Petrovsky Castle; and the fame
     rings proudly in that sombre name.
     From here, deep-sunk in pensive woe,
     No feast, no welcome-gifts -- with fire
     nor crawled in suppliant attire.
     till Moscow, meekly on its knees,
     gave up the ancient Kremlin-keys:
     he gazed out on the threatening glow.
     {195}

        XXXVIII

     the pillars of the turnpike-gate;
     drive on! And now we see a-shimmer
     Farewell, Petrovsky Castle, glimmer
     parks, monasteries, towers and ledges,
     peasants, and fashion-shops, and sledges,
     Bokharans, orchards, merchants, shacks,
     boulevards, chemists, and Cossacks,
     boys, country women, stately halls,
     Street lamps go flashing by, and stalls,
     and, on the crosses, jackdaw hosts.
     lions adorning gateway posts
     of fallen glory. Well! don't wait,
     along Tverskaya Street already
     the potholes make the coach unsteady.

        (XXXIX,2) XL

     with a consumption, they've relied.
     And now the door is opened wide,
     On an old aunt, who's long been burning
     a mansion stands just round a turning.
     a grizzled Calmuck stands to meet them,
     stretched on a sofa, calls to greet them.
     This wearisome perambulation
     the coach has reached its destination;
     and from the salon the princess,
     bespectacled, in tattered dress;
     takes up an hour or two; at last
     after Saint Chariton's gone past
     thickly the exclamations fly.
     The two old ladies kiss and cry;
     {196}

        XLI

     ``Princess, mon ange!'' ``Pachette!'' ``Alina!''
     ``How long can you... ?'' ``Dearest kuzina!''
     ``Who would have thought it?'' ``What an age!''
     ``Sit down! how strange! it's like the stage
     I do, I do. Well, where's he gone?''
     ``What, Grandison? oh, Grandison!
     ``Here, near Saint Simeon; in December,
     Grandison, cousin, d'you remember?''
     Tatyana's here, you know I've brought her...''
     or else a novel.'' ``And my daughter
     I'm wandering in a world of dreams...
     ``Ah, Tanya, come to me, it seems
     lately he married off his boy.''
     on Christmas Eve, he wished me joy:

        XLII

     outside the house. But you'll be aching
     after your drive, it's quite back-breaking;
     is that my feet lack strength to go
     These days I'm finding even gladness,
     you age, and life's just grief and sadness...''
     not only pain, too much to meet...
     I'm good for nothing now, my sweet...
     Oh, I've no strength... I'm tired, my chest...
     let's go together, take a rest...
     she burst into a coughing-bout.
     With that, in tears, and quite worn out,
     we'll talk, and talk, and then we'll show
     ``As for the other one... tomorrow
     Tanya to all her kin. My sorrow

        XLIII

     a stall, a kitchen and a fence.
     An unknown yard, she sees from thence,
     the occupations of the morning.
     no vision of her fields is dawning.
     She sits down by the window-sill.
     The darkness thins away; but still
     in that new couch, no sleep for certain;
     No sleep, beneath that silken curtain,
     the strangeness of her habitation,
     The invalid's glad salutation,
     the early pealing of the bells
     lifts her from bed as it foretells
     after her own room, makes her fret.
     her kindness, move Tatyana; yet

        XLIV

     you in my arms on gingerbread?''
     how long is it?'' ``And since I fed
     And all grandmothers who are listening
     just yesterday.'' ``And since your christening
     For cousins from afar, on meeting
     there never fails a kindly greeting,
     The kinsfolk in concerted action
     present her languor and distraction
     ``How Tanya's grown! I pulled your ear
     and exclamations, and good cheer.
     to fresh grandparents every day.
     ask Tanya out to dine, and they
     ``My goodness, how the years do fly!''
     in unison repeat the cry:

     a liar still, Lyubóv Petrovna,
     still powdered is Lukérya Lvovna,
     and then old cousin Pelagéya
     Iván Petróvich still is dumb,
     same Pom, same husband to the end;
     still has Monsieur Finemouche for friend,
     Semyón Petróvich, mean and glum,
     still meek, still deaf as howd'youdo,
     still eats and drinks enough for two.
     he's at the club, a real stayer,
     adorns Aunt Helen, the princess;
     they all still keep their old impress:
     still made of tulle, the self-same bonnet
     Their look, though, shows no change upon it --

        XLVI

     she's their great friend, asked in, caressed,
     her hands affectionately pressed;
     a bit provincial and affected,
     they find her somewhat unexpected,
     while she's from top to toe surveyed;
     Tanya is gripped. No comment's made
     and in a singsong voice confide
     the inmost thoughts that girls can hide.
     too pale, too thin, but on the whole
     not bad at all; and then each soul
     they fluff her curls out in the fashion,
     gives way to nature's normal passion:
     And in their daughters' close embraces
     at first by Moscow's youthful graces
     {199}

        XLVII

     a treasure never to be shared.
     as something not to be declared,
     she guards, in silence and for good,
     there's not a word she's understood;
     Then in return for all this twaddle,
     from her they strive to coax and coddle
     coated with a thin layer of spite.
     as if she'd been profoundly sleeping,
     her sacred store of bliss and weeping
     Each others' and their own successes,
     and so the harmless chat progresses
     their hopes, their pranks, their dreams at night --
     a full confession of the heart.
     Tatyana hears but takes no part;

        XLVIII

     in question, gossip, news and tale,
     in talk, so fruitless and so stale,
     not even by chance, once in a while,
     will the benighted reason smile,
     is with dull trash that can't cohere:
     everything's dim and unenthusing;
     even the scandal's not amusing;
     but the salon's preoccupation

     a joker in the old tradition,
     High rank, of course, and fashion's glasses,

     she once had pined in girlish grief,
     maiden in this superb, unthinking

     the climacteric of our life,

     but youthful, virgin hearts derive
     like fields in spring when storms arrive.
     In passion's sluicing rain they freshen,
     ripen, and find a new expression --
     Love tyrannises all the ages;
     a blessing from its blasts and rages,
     But when a later age has found us,
     as when chill autumn rains surround us,
     of sumptuous flowers and luscious fruit.

     she doesn't see, or doesn't mind;

     he's got consumption. In his anguish
     At home she'll equably receive him,

     and rightly so, but now his pain
     He deemed, in general, letters vain,
     had gone in no uncertain fashion
     he sends a letter, penned with passion.
     with his forefathers would seem better;
     But go he won't: for him, a letter
     fixing an early rendezvous
     active, and hopeful, and insistent:

        Onegin's Letter to Tatyana

     ``I know it all: my secret ache
     that your proud glance is sure to take!
     my declaration may give rise!
     will anger you in its confession.
     What scorn I see in the expression
     What do I want? what am I after,
     I know to what malicious laughter
     stripping my soul before your eyes!

     for happiness, I sought, and ranged
     unloved, and friendless, and estranged.
     Lensky, that tragic victim, died...
     since then my heart was wrenched aside;
     my tedious taste for feeling free.
     yet dared not trust what I could see.
     From all sweet things that gave me pleasure,
     And then, to part us in full measure,
     in you a tender pulse was beating,
     ``I noticed once, at our chance meeting,
     I gave no rein to sweet affection:
     what held me was my predilection,
     What folly! and what retribution!
     freedom and peace, in substitution

     its image, then to swoon before
     your words, and in my soul to explore
     your matchlessness, to seek to capture
     your feet, to pale and waste... what rapture!
     watch for your smile, and catch your gaze
     ``No, every minute of my days,
     with eyes of love, with greed to swallow
     to see you, faithfully to follow,
     {222}

     I count each hour the whole day through;
     my span, that fortune's jurisdiction
     I must wake up with the conviction
     and yet in vain ennui I squander
     I drag my footsteps hither, yonder;
     has fixed; but for my heart to beat
     that somehow that same day we'll meet...
     And how they weigh! I know about
     the days that doom has measured out.
     ``But I'm denied this: all for you

     to cool my glances and my tongue,
     ``I dread your stern regard surmising
     a calculation past despising --
     to talk as if with heart unwrung,
     I hear the wrath of your reproach.
     in my petition an approach,
     to sob out prayer, complaint, confession,
     how fearful, too, is my obsession
     to burn -- and then by force of reason
     How fearful, in and out of season
     and every plea that lips can treat;
     to clasp your knees, and at your feet
     to pine away from passion's thirst,
     to stem the bloodstream's wild outburst;
     and look serenely on your beauty!...
     meanwhile with a dissembler's duty

     and I surrender to my fate.''
     ``But so it is: I'm in no state
     I'm yours, in a predestined fashion,

     No tearstains, nothing. Wrath alone
     is graven on that face of stone.
     Onegin looks with eyes of fire:
     is all those stubborn lips desire!
     No look, no word for him: she's chosen
     she appears before him, grim and frozen.
     To batten down their indignation
     where are distress, commiseration?
     No answer comes. He goes, for better

     his thoughts were on a distant goal:

     he hears a voice; ``well, what? he's killed!''

     motionless as one soundly sleeping
     sits there beside the window-sill!
     a country house -- and one who still
     And foes he sees, long-since forgotten,
     comrades despised, and comrades rotten;

     by blazing fireplace, and intone
     and on the flames let fall unseen
     He got so used to this immersion,
     or joined us poets. His conversion
     of Russian verse, its force in action, --
     It's true, the magnet-like attraction

     while, marmot-like, he hibernated --
     has kept him warm in chimney's blaze
     apartment where a double glaze
     along the Neva in a sleigh,
     He's neither died, nor lost his reason,
     The days flew past; by now the season
     nor turned a poet. In the burst

     He goes inside, corpse-like of feature...
     the hall's without a living creature,
     to his Tatyana, yes, he's racing,
     she holds a letter up, and leaning
     that strikes him with such force and meaning?
     over the slush, where is he chasing?
     You've guessed before it all began:
     my strange, incorrigible man.
     The princess, sitting peaked and wan,
     alone, with no adornment on;
     cheek upon hand she softly cries
     in a still stream that never dries.

     Who in that flash could not have reckoned
     threw Eugene at her feet -- she stirred,
     Who in the princess for that second
     and looked at him without a word,
     in her once more has come alive.
     whose heart on dreams was wont to thrive,
     his dull, sick look, his dumb reproach --
     his humbly suppliant approach,
     without surprise or rage... his laden,
     she sees it all. The simple maiden,
     would not have recognized again
     her full account of voiceless pain?
     our hapless Tanya! An emotion
     of wild repentance and devotion

     then quietly at last says she:
     when in the park, in the allée
     ``Enough, stand up. It's now for me
     to meet his thirsty lips... What daze,

     allows her hand, that's lost all feeling,
     Tatyana leaves Onegin kneeling,
     to give you honest explanation.
     where fate had fixed our confrontation,
     A pause of silence and inaction,
     what dream accounts for her distraction?
     Today it's turn and turn about.
     humbly I heard your lesson out?
     Onegin, d'you recall the day

     and also prettier, I'll be bound,
     what was it in your heart it found
     nothing you did gave cause for blame:
     freezes my blood... Yet all the same,
     you acted well, that dread occasion,
     your icy look, your stern dissuasion,
     what's more, I loved you; but my hunger,
     ``For then, Onegin, I was younger,
     for you, I think, the humble dimness
     that could sustain it? Only grimness;
     I'm grateful now with all my heart.
     you took an honourable part --
     But now -- oh God! -- the thought of you,
     of lovelorn girls was nothing new?

        XLIV

     and so in the salons could make
     a tempting plume for you to take?
     my husband for his wounds in battle
     would cause widespread remark and tattle,
     and riches, and the wish to thank
     I move in the grand monde? that rank,
     What cause has won me your attention?
     Could it not be that by convention
     I'd nothing to attract your humour...
     ``Then, in the backwoods, far from rumour
     that, for all this, my shame's report

     your cold discourse, were less unkind --
     your Tanya's image in your mind,
     to all that's trivial and inane?
     What trifling could be more complete?
     respect, and mercy for my dreaming.
     What power enslaves you, with your seeming
     advantages of heart and brain,
     if I had power to choose your fashion --
     than this humiliating passion
     then know that your reproving finger,
     ``I weep... In case there still should linger

     my house, my evenings, all that state --
     this very day I'd gladly give,
     the glare, the fumes in which I live,
     what's in them? All this loud parading,
     and all this flashy masquerading,
     a humble cross, in woodland gloom,

     behind deceit or double-dealing?)
     I know your heart: it has a feeling

     Reader, I wish that, as we parted --
     whoever you may be, a friend,
     Goodbye, for now we make an end.
     for dreams, or journalistic battle,
     a vivid brush, a witty rattle --
     God grant that from this little book
     for heart's delight, or fun, you took,
     On this we'll part; goodbye again!
     God grant you took at least a grain.

     you sought -- tumultuous recollection,
     a rest from toil and all its aches,

     goodbye to you, my true ideal,

     since, through the mist that dreams arise on,
     a free romance's far horizon,
     still dim, through crystal's magic glass,
     before my gaze began to pass.
     my task, so vivid and so serious
     And my companion, so mysterious,
     sweet talk with friends. How many days
     oblivion of life's stormy ways,
     and enviable for a poet,
     in your pursuit I've come to know it:
