    After a fine career, his father
    had only debts on which to live.
    He gave three balls a year, and rather
    promptly had nothing left to give.
    Fate saved Evgeny from perdition:
    at first Madame gave him tuition,
    from her Monsieur took on the child.
    He was sweet-natured, and yet wild.
    Monsieur l'Abb√©, the mediocre,
    reluctant to exhaust the boy,
    treated his lessons as a ploy.
    No moralizing from this joker;
    a mild rebuke was his worst mark,
    and then a stroll in Letny Park.
